    <body style="background-color:powderblue;"></p>Hello There, My name is David, and I am a simple man trying to live a simple life. I am Tex-Mex, and my house is basically a night club. The reason my place is a night club is because people always come over to eat food, drink water, dance, and don't leave until 2 a.m. I also attend to Palo Alto College whenever I'm not running my night club
